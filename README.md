# MSc Project: Data Analysis of Particle Collisions at Large Hardon Collider

 -- Simulating proton-proton collision events, generating data of physical quantities using Linux-based simulation software, and constructing new features and images using theoretical learning.
 -- Building Regression predictive models for physical quantities, Classification and Anomaly detection models to classify signal and background events using ANN, CNN and Auto-Encoders. Creating Clustering models for Jets clustering using Anti-KT Algorithm.
